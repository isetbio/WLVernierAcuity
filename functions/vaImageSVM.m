%  mdl.Beta appears to be the term that we multiply as an inner product
%  with the data to determine whether the stimulus is type (A) or (not A).
%  The sign of this value determines
%
%     x'*mdl.Beta + Bias
%
%  The data in mdl.Beta have size of tSamples*nBasis. For example, if there
%  are 150 tSamples in a trial, and 10 spatial image components, then Beta
%  is 1500.
%
%  If we want to express the meaning of these values we need to create a
%  movie in image space by multiplying the imageBasis by the weights at
%  each of the time points. So the classifier is a movie.  Find the vector
%  of nBasis weights, multiply that vector times the image basis, and that
%  provides the classifier weights at that moment in time.  Then move to
%  the next moment in time and multiply again.
